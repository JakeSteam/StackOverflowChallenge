## Setup instructions
1. Check out repo
2. Build!

## Architecture
Architecture is very simply due to only having one piece of functionality, and requiring activities instead of fragments. The project could easily be converted to MVP if further functionality was to be added.

## Libraries used
* **UI**: AndroidX's appcompat, recyclerview, and constraintlayout
* **Network**: Retrofit2 (inc. an RxJava extension) & OkHttp
* **Observables**: RxJava / RxAndroid
* **Images**: Picasso
* **UI Testing**: Espresso (core / intents / contrib), AndroidX's test runner & rules, OkHttp's MockWebServer
